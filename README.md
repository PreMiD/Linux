## About

**PreMiD** is a simple, configurable utility that uses Discord's RP ( Rich Presence ) library which allows you to show what you're doing on the web ( and a few programs ) in your Discord profile as **playing status**.

<a name="requirements"></a>

### Requirements

Technically every distribution that can run Discord's [official](https://discordapp.com/download) **app** ( not the web or the snap version ) can run PreMiD too;</br>
As you may have noticed in the recent years, some Linux distributions started dropping support for the 32-bit (ia32/i686/i386/x86) architectures, and as a result, we did too. You can, however, try to build the app yourself if you desperately need to use it on a 32-bit distribution.</br>
Since we currently use Electron as an engine (Discord does too!), its requirements also apply to this app :

- Ubuntu ≥ 12.04
- Fedora ≥ 21
- Debian ≥ 8

It is unknown whether older versions of other distributions support it, so just keep your distribution updated and use **LTS (Long-Term Support)** releases if your distribution offers them, as they're more stable (avoid alpha releases).

## Snapcraft

Probably never, since Snap's nature blocks PreMiD from reaching Discord and the extension properly,</br>
It would be appreciated if someone could do it though, any ideas or PRs are welcome.</br>
P.S.: classic confinement doesn't work either so don't bother making a suggestion about it.

<img src=".github/appimage.png" width="100" height="100" align="right"></img>
<a name="appimage"></a>

## Portable AppImage

The AppImage package is the recommended one if Discord works for you but other PreMiD packages (.deb, .rpm, etc) don't.

<a name="appimageinstall"></a>

### Installation instructions

```bash
wget https://github.com/PreMiD/Linux/releases/latest/download/PreMiD-Portable.AppImage && chmod a+x PreMiD*.AppImage
```

```bash
# Just double-click it or run
./PreMiD*.AppImage
```

<a name="appimagenotes"></a>

### Additional notes

Either if you want to try PreMiD or just don't want to install it, this one's the best, it's always up to date but _DOESN'T AUTO-START WITH THE SYSTEM!_</br>If you get tired of having to open it each time, use the other packages (according to your distribution).

# Package managers

<a name="packagecloud"></a>

## PackageCloud

With scripts below you can install our repos to your package manager and install our program and update it from their command! For .deb or .rpm files, please check [this link](https://packagecloud.io/PreMiD/Linux).

- **Ubuntu** or **Debian**:

```bash
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/PreMiD/Linux/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
```
Then run: ``sudo apt install premid``

- **Fedora** or **CentOS** or **RedHat**:

```bash
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/PreMiD/Linux/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
```
Then run: ``yum install premid`` or use different package manager than ``yum``.

If command doesn't work, download **deb** or **rpm** file from our packagecloud repo or override settings.

## Arch Linux based distributions

Uses [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/premid);</br>
Supported distributions are _itself_, Manjaro, Anarchy, Artix, Arco, ArchLabs, Endeavour, Archman, BlackArch, Liri OS and [every one that supports installing from AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch-based_distributions#Active).

<a name="archinstall"></a>

### Installation instructions

```bash
# Using yay (recommended)
yay -S premid
```

```bash
# Using pakku
pakku -S premid
```

```bash
# Using trizen
trizen -S premid
```

```bash
# Using pacaur
pacaur -S premid
```

```bash
# ... you get the point
```

or manually from the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/premid) if you know what you're doing.

<a name="archnotes"></a>

### Additional notes

If your distro uses pacman, then you have to install one of the helpers first. If you don't have any, Yay is recommended, run :

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git && cd yay && makepkg -si
```

```bash
yay -S premid
```

Other AUR/Pacman helpers work as well, although each one's functionality is different so you may face issues while using them.
